# useHotkeys

The `useHotkeys` hook follows the hotkeys call signature.
The callback function takes the exact parameters as the callback function in the hotkeys package.
See hotkeys documentation for more info or look into the typings file.

```ts
useHotkeys(keys: string, callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void)
```

## Example

This will listen to the `ctrl+k` keystroke. If you press it, the counter will go up.

```js
import { useHotkeys } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';
```

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useHotkeys('ctrl+k', () => setCount(count + 1));

  return (
    <div>
      Pressed {count} times.
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('ctrl+k', () => setCount(count + 1))

    return (
      <div>
        Pressed {count} times.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>
