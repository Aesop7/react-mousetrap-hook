# useHotkeys

The `useHotkeys` hook follows the hotkeys call signature.

The callback function takes the exact parameters as the callback function in the hotkeys package.
See hotkeys documentation for more info or look into the typings file.

When the component gets mounted into the DOM it will listen for the keystroke. When it gets unmount it stops listening
for the keystroke.

```ts
useHotkeys(keys: string, callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void)
```

## Example

This will listen to the `ctrl+k` keystroke. If you press it, the counter increment by one. If `ctrl+l` gets pressed the
counter will decrement by one.

```js
import { useHotkeys } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';
```

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useHotkeys('ctrl+k', () => setCount(count + 1));
  useHotkeys('ctrl+l', () => setCount(count - 1));

  return (
    <div>
      Pressed {count} times.
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('ctrl+k', () => setCount(count + 1))
    useHotkeys('ctrl+l', () => setCount(count - 1))

    return (
      <div>
        Pressed {count} times.
      </div>
    );
  }}
